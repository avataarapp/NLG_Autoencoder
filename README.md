# Natural Language Generation

Here is my PyTorch implementation of "Unsupervised Natural Language Generation with Denoising Autoencoders" ([on arXiv here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07899.pdf)).


Natural Language Generation with a denoising autoencoder
=======
# NLG_Autoencoder

An implementation of ["Unsupervised Natural Language Generation with Denoising Autoencoders"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07899) by Markus Freitag and Scott Roy in PyTorch. This model trains a denoising autoencoder with a bidirectional LSTM network to generate natural sounding language.

Still a work in progress, but it's able to train successfully.
