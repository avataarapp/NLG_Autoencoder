# NLG_Autoencoder

An implementation of ["Unsupervised Natural Language Generation with Denoising Autoencoders"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.07899) by Markus Freitag and Scott Roy in PyTorch. This model trains a denoising autoencoder with a bidirectional LSTM network to generate natural sounding language.

Still a work in progress, but it's able to train successfully.
